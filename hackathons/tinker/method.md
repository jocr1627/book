# Method

The main question is too general and too vague. As a class, we brainstormed
and came up with a list of specific questions that are easier to tackle while useful
for making the decision.

From the class discussion, we wrote down five specific questions that are particularly interesting.

* How many total pushes on Github a given language?
* How many pushes per repository for a given language?
* How many forks per repository for a given language?
* How many stars per repostiory for a given language?
* How many watchers per repository for a given language?

From the above list, my team chose a question, worked on it, and created a report on the next page.
